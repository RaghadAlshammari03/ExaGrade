**Key capabilities include:**
- Handwriting recognition for scanned papers using **HandwritingOCR API**  
- Auto-grading for multiple question types with **ChatGPT API**  
- Intelligent flagging for ambiguous responses requiring manual review  
- PDF generation with live preview and full exam lifecycle tracking

## ‚ú® Features

### **1. Courses & Exams Management** 
- **Courses Dashboard:** Instructors can create and share course codes; students join with a 6-digit code.

  - *Pending:* No student responses have been graded yet  
  - *In Progress:* Some, but not all responses have been graded  
  - *Requires Attention:* At least one flagged question requires manual review

  - Automatic detection of doubtful or unclear answers, flagged for manual intervention  

### **3. Live PDF Preview During Exam Creation**
While creating or editing a paper exam, the screen is split into two sections:
